% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\begin{abstract}
In developing countries, effectiveness of disaster management systems can be measured through adoption. To ensure that the general public embraces the technology, the design of the system should be technology inclusive. eBayanihan is a nationwide web - mobile participatory disaster management system which captures the human dimension of disaster by allowing ordinary citizens to post incidents as they experience it. This paper discusses possible solutions to problems encountered in the SMS based platform in eBayanihan. Specifically, we address the problem of correcting incorrect syntax. (we will place our solution here).

\section{Disasters in the Philippines}
More recently, an average of 19 typhoons enter the area of responsibility with around 6 to 9 making a landfall on Philippine soil \cite{shoemaker1991:typhoons}. In 2014, there was a total of X tropical rainstorms that hit the Philippines causing Y pesos of damage as well as Z loss of lives. In year, the Philippine government through Republic Act No. established the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council whose primary role is to enter role here. There are N clusters in this council ranging from enter clusters here. The cluster in Information Communications Technology (ICT) requires managing communication infrastructure as will as delivering information from top down (official news to the public) as well as bottom up (public information to the national level). 

\section{Review of Existing Disaster Information Systems}

In the Philippines, there have been efforts in contributing to the development of disaster management systems and applications to collect and report disaster related information. Discuss systems here.

As of enter 2013, the Philippines received a worldwide rank of 12 in the mobile phone ownership with a ratio of enter ratios here. Since only 30 percent of the mobile users own a smart phone, there is still a need to provide an SMS based application for disaster reporting.

\subsection{Types}

\subsection{Measuring Effectiveness}

\section{SMS based platforms}
\subsection{Design}
The SMS based application was designed to accept reports based on the following syntax:

enter figure of SMS to eBayanihan

\subsection{Problems}

To send an SMS report to eBayanihan, a specific format has to be followed so that it can 
be parsed properly by the system. The SMS is then parsed for a keyword, urgency level, barangay,
city or municipality and then the actual report. Location information is then extracted from the SMS
and used to map the report. 

With this in mind, there are three problems that may occur with an SMS report.
First, the SMS sent may not follow the proper format (there are extra or missing commas). Place example.

Second, keywords and urgency level may be misspelled, thus confusing the system. Place example.

Third, the location extracted may not be geo-locatable, which may occur because a) the names of places are misspelled, b) the place has not yet been mapped by the services used
(Google Maps, Nominatim).

\section{Proposed Solution}
There are two possible approaches in solving the problem, namely by correction and approximation. I will explain futher here.

\subsection{Correction}
One possible approach to the problem of erroneous SMS reports is to attempt to correct them. A program first queries the database fro new SMS that have been deemed to be wrong. The format is checked and fixed if there are mistakes. Afterward, spelling correctors may be run based on a dictionary of keywords (for misspelled keywords) and a dictionary of all the barangays and cities in the Philippines (for misspelled places). After fixing these problems, a gazetteer may then be used to get latitude and longitude for the specified place. 

\subsubsection{Fixing the Format}
\subsubsection{Approximate String Matching}
One approach to the misspelled words problem is to find the closest string in the given dictionary and then
replacing the string with that one. Afterward, this may then be passed on to the gazetteer query stage. Numerous
string distance metrics allow this kind of approximate matching. Hamming distance, Levenshtein distance, Damerau-Levenshtein
distance, Longest Common Subsequence and Longest Common Substring are just some examples of these distance metrics. 

Levenshtein distance, or edit distance, is a commonly used metric in approximate string matching and spelling correction. In Peter Norvig's trials, he claims that around 76\% of errors were within an edit distance of one and 98.9\% were within a distance of two \cite{norvig:howto}. It is defined as the minimum number of operations required to change one string into another. The operations defined are insertion (addition of an extra letter), deletion (removal of a character from the string), and substitution (replacing one character with another). Damerau-Levenshtein distance is an extension of this that keeps the three operations, but adds a fourth one, namely transposition
or the flipping of adjacent characters.  

Since there are only 15 keywords and 2 urgency levels, correcting errors given the dictionary is a simple task of selecting
the word with the smallest edit distance when compared to a certain query. Since only a few comparisons are needed, a straightforward
dynamic programming approach was taken using the given recurrence relation. 

<INSERT RECURRENCE RELATION HERE> 

While the same approach may be used for the names of places, the dictionary here is a lot larger. With over a thousand cities, 
over a thousand municipalities and thousands of barangays, a straightforward comparison approach will be too slow (given the
O(mn) run time of the dynamic programming approach). To solve this problem of efficiency, the group implemented two different tree-based solutions. The first is a hybrid of a trie and the dynamic programming approach, while the second is an implementation of a BK-Tree. 

\subsubsection{Trie with Dynamic Programming}
A trie is a tree data structure where nodes can contain different keys pertaining to parts of a word. In this algorithm's case, each node contains a character. By using a trie, redundant computations are prevented, as prefixes to the wide range of words in the dictionary will only have to be involved in the computations once. In other words, the memoization array used in the dynamic programming algorithm is recycled, and carried over to other words with the same prefix.

<ADD PICTURE OF SAMPLE TRIE HERE> 

Instead of simply using Levenshtein distance, the group instead opted to use the string optimal alignment distance function, which is a slightly restricted version of the Damerau-Levenshtein distance mentioned earlier. It also counts four operations instead of the three by the Levenshtein distance function, however, a single substring cannot be edited more than once. For example, the Damerau-Levenshtein distance of "`there"' and "`etre"' is two, as one can flip the first and second letters or "`etre"' and then insert an "`h"' in between. Its optimal string alignment distance, however, is three because after the initial transposition of the first two letters, one cannot insert another letter (the substring has already been edited). While more restrictive than Damerau-Levenshtein distance, this metric is sufficient for the purposes of the algorithm (approximate matching of wrongly spelled words). 

\subsubsection{BK-Trees}

\subsection{Approximations}
Text mining is proposed approximation approach in solving the problem. In this approach, the syntax is almost disregarded as input string is tokenized and compared to a lookup table for matching. The difference in this approach is that there is a validation process that happens in every correct or incorrect match so there is a percentage increase or decrease in the matching or relevance score. 

We will use a machine learning classification algo here to tag correct and incorrect match.

\section{Results}
\section{Discussion}

\subsubsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
A formula that appears in the running text is called an
inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
\textbf{math} environment, which can be
invoked with the usual \texttt{{\char'134}begin. . .{\char'134}end}
construction or with the short form \texttt{\$. . .\$}. You
can use any of the symbols and structures,
from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
this equation: \begin{math}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsubsection{Display Equations}
A numbered display equation -- one set off by vertical space
from the text and centered horizontally -- is produced
by the \textbf{equation} environment. An unnumbered display
equation is produced by the \textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in \LaTeX; this section will just
give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\subsection{Citations}
Citations to articles \cite{bowman:reasoning, clark:pct, braams:babel, herlihy:methodology},
conference
proceedings \cite{clark:pct} or books \cite{salas:calculus, Lamport:LaTeX} listed
in the Bibliography section of your
article will occur throughout the text of your article.
You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
a key of the item cited in the proper location in
the \texttt{.tex} file \cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
the first author's surname and a
word from the title.  This identifying key is included
with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.

The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

This article shows only the plainest form
of the citation command, using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.
This is what is stipulated in the SIGS style specifications.
No other citation format is endorsed.

\subsection{Tables}
Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
placement for them is typically the top of the page
nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
on \textbf{tabular} material
is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 1 is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed
dvi output of this document.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\ \hline
\O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\ \hline
$\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\ \hline
\$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\ \hline
$\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
the page's live area, use the environment
\textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this wide
table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 2 is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the
table here with the table in the printed dvi
output of this document.


\begin{table*}
\centering
\caption{Some Typical Commands}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Command&A Number&Comments\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}alignauthor} & 100& Author alignment\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}numberofauthors}& 200& Author enumeration\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\ \hline\end{tabular}
\end{table*}
% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

\subsection{Figures}
Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the
best placement for them
is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest
their initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement
of figures, use the environment
\textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and its caption.

This sample document contains examples of \textbf{.eps}
and \textbf{.ps} files to be displayable with \LaTeX.  More
details on each of these is found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

As was the case with tables, you may want a figure
that spans two columns.  To do this, and still to
ensure proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
\textbf{figure*} to enclose the figure and its caption.

Note that either {\textbf{.ps}} or {\textbf{.eps}} formats are
used; use
the \texttt{{\char'134}epsfig} or \texttt{{\char'134}psfig}
commands as appropriate for the different file types.

\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
corollaries and proofs.  There are
two forms, one produced by the
command \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} and the
other by the command \texttt{{\char'134}newdef}; perhaps
the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
to compare the two in the output of this sample document:

This uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
the\linebreak\texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} command:
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
\begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
\end{theorem}

The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
by the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command:
\newdef{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
unique number which has
logarithm $z$: \begin{displaymath}{\log e^z = z}\end{displaymath}
\end{definition}

Two lists of constructs that use one of these
forms is given in the
\textit{Author's  Guidelines}.

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\epsfig{file=flies.eps}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic (.eps format)
that needs to span two columns of text.}
\end{figure*}
and don't forget to end the environment with
{figure*}, not {figure}!
 
There is one other similar construct environment, which is
already set up
for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
a \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to
create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
is a example of its use:
\begin{proof}
Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
\end{displaymath}
Then
\begin{displaymath}
l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
\end{displaymath}
which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
\end{proof}

Complete rules about using these environments and using the
two different creation commands are in the
\textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct,
not listed therein, which you want to have the same
formatting as the Theorem
or the Definition\cite{salas:calculus} shown above,
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} or the
\texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command,
respectively, to create it.

\subsection*{A {\secit Caveat} for the \TeX\ Expert}
Because you have just been given permission to
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to create a
new form, you might think you can
use \TeX's \texttt{{\char'134}def} to create a
new command: \textit{Please refrain from doing this!}
Remember that your \LaTeX\ source code is primarily intended
to create camera-ready copy, but may be converted
to other forms -- e.g. HTML. If you inadvertently omit
some or all of the \texttt{{\char'134}def}s recompilation will
be, to say the least, problematic.

\section{Conclusions}
This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
Appendices; brief samples of these
follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
this paper are to articles which have nothing to
do with the present subject and are used as
examples only.
